# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
Airline travel has become one of the most used means of transportation in the last decades. With the  frequent travel by customers, there is a lot of increase in the airlines and so is the demand. To keep  the existing customers and attract the new ones in the very competitive environment, airlines need to  try all ways to improve them by keeping up with costs and services. To explore airline customer satisfaction, this research employs a CRISP-DM methodology. More  precisely, feature selection is used to determine the sort of service that airline passengers demand the  most. To obtain better-predicted outcomes and compare them, we use different classifiers rather than  just one.
